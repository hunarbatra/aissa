    "\n",
    "This lab is split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1️⃣ We'll first introduce the `TransformerLens` (TL) library, recall the basics of transformer-based large language models, and see how TL provides useful tools for inspecting intermediate activations, and intervening during the forward pass.\n",
    "    * During this introduction, we'll learn how to add activation hooks to ablate various components--a very rudimentary tool for mechanistic interpretability!\n",
    "* 2️⃣ Following this, we'll jump into an excellent (shortened) tutorial directly from [ARENA](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.4.1]_Indirect_Object_Identification), which walks through how to use two additional tools for mechanistic interpretability of large language models:\n",

    "    \n",
    "The lab will introduce a range of tools for mechanistic interpretability by way of exploring the so-called ['indirect object identification'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) (an optional paper on the day 3 reading list) task to ground our exploration. We'll see more details about this task later (note: this notebook aims to be totally self-contained, and no prior familiarity with the task should be necessary)\n",

    "### 2️⃣ Caching activations\n",

    "Next, we'll look at how to return the intermediate activations throughout the network during a forward pass. If we want to manipulate internal activations/mechanisms, we first need to know how to get them! TransformerLens makes this very easy.\n",

    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Recall the basic components of a gpt2-style encoder-only transformer language model.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Intervening during a forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simply returning intermediate representations for monitoring, interpretability, feature analysis (etc), it's often useful to make **interventions** into the forward pass itself, to make predictable changes to the output!\n",
    "\n",

    "> * Understand how TransformerLens hooks relates to PyTorch hooks and model interventions\n",
    "> * Write your own model hooks with TransformerLens, for:\n",
    ">     * zero-ablation\n",
    ">     * tensor token manipulation at specific target points\n",
    "> * Reason about which categories of layers might be performing which kinds of tasks, and use this knowledge to bring target changes to the model outputs.\n",

    "1. Zero ablation is a crude test of the necessity of the activations for the IOI task (why?)\n",
    "    * Caveat: the zero vector will be out-of-distribution, and may risk destroying the ability of the model to perform the task for this (unrelated) reason alone!\n",
    "4. What might a test for sufficiency for a \"layers' activations' importance on the IOI task\" look like? What properties might it have, in terms of changes to model outputs?\n",
    "    * Hint: when using zero ablation to probe for the importance of activations, the process is: \"start with the model producing the *correct* output, then modify the activations such that the output is *incorrect*\" -- can we re-order this setup to lead to the above?\n",

On the simpler side, you have something like inspecting attention patterns, which can give a decent (but sometimes misleading) picture of what an attention head is doing. These should be some of the first tools you reach for, and you should be using them a lot even before you have concrete hypotheses about a circuit. On the more rigorous side, you have something like path patching, which is a pretty rigorous and effortful tool that is best used when you already have reasonably concrete hypotheses about a circuit (note: which we won't be covering in the AISAA lab!). As we go through the exercises, we'll transition from left to right along this spectrum."

    "## The IOI task\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when trying to reverse engineer a circuit in a model is to identify *what* capability we want to reverse engineer. Indirect Object Identification is a task studied in Redwood Research's excellent [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper (see [Neel Nanda's interview with the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) or [Kevin Wang's Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587601532639494146.html) for an overview). The task is to complete sentences like \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \" Mary\" rather than \" John\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper they rigorously reverse engineer a 26 head circuit, with 7 separate categories of heads used to perform this capability. The circuit they found roughly breaks down into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify what names are in the sentence\n",
    "2. Identify which names are duplicated\n",
    "3. Predict the name that is *not* duplicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was this task chosen? The authors give a very good explanation for their choice in their [video walkthrough of their paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo), which you are encouraged to watch. To be brief, some of the reasons were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a fairly common grammatical structure, so we should expect the model to build some circuitry for solving it quite early on (after it's finished with all the more basic stuff, like n-grams, punctuation, induction, and simpler grammatical structures than this one).\n",
    "* It's easy to measure: the model always puts a much higher probability on the IO and S tokens (i.e. `\" Mary\"` and `\" John\"`) than any others, and this is especially true once the model starts being stripped down to the core part of the circuit we're studying. So we can just take the logit difference between these two tokens, and use this as a metric for how well the model can solve the task.\n",
    "* It is a crisp and well-defined task, so less likely to be solved in terms of memorisation of a large bag of heuristics (unlike e.g. tasks like \"predict that the number `n+1` will follow `n`, which as Neel mentions in the video walkthrough is actually much more annoying and subtle than it first seems!).\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminology note: `IO` will refer to the indirect object (in the example, `\" Mary\"`), `S1` and `S2` will refer to the two instances of the subject token (i.e. `\" John\"`), and `end` will refer to the end token `\" to\"` (because this is the position we take our prediction from, and we don't care about any tokens after this point). We will also sometimes use `S` to refer to the identity of the subject token (rather than referring to the first or second instance in particular)."

You'll be exposed to new functions and modules from transformerlens, new ways to causally intervene in models, all the while building up your understanding of how the IOI task is performed. The notebook starts off exploratory in nature (lots of plotting and investigation), and gradually moves into more technical details, refined analysis, and replication of the paper's results, as we improve our understanding of the IOI circuit. You are recommended to keep a document or page of notes nearby as you go through these exercises, so you can keep track of the main takeaways from each section, as well as your hypotheses for how the model performs the task, and your ideas for how you might go off and test these hypotheses on your own if the notebook were to suddenly end.\n",

    "First, let's start with an analogy for how transformers work (you can skip this if you've already read [my post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/euam65XjigaCJQkcN/an-analogy-for-understanding-transformers)). Imagine a line of people, who can only look forward. Each person has a token written on their chest, and their goal is to figure out what token the person in front of them is holding. Each person is allowed to pass a question backwards along the line (not forwards), and anyone can choose to reply to that question by passing information forwards to the person who asked. In this case, the sentence is `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`. You are the person holding the `\" to\"` token, and your goal is to figure out that the person in front of him has the `\" Mary\"` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear about how this analogy relates to transformers:\n",
    "* Each person in the line represents a vector in the residual stream. Initially they just store their own token, but they accrue more information as they ask questions and receive answers (i.e. as components write to the residual stream)\n",
    "* The operation of an attention head is represented by a question & answer:\n",
    "    * The person who asks is the destination token, the people who answer are the source tokens\n",
    "    * The question is the query vector\n",
    "    * The information *which determines who answers the question* is the key vector\n",
    "    * The information *which gets passed back to the original asker* is the value vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here is how the IOI circuit works in this analogy. Each bullet point represents a class of attention heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person with the second `\" John\"` token asks the question \"does anyone else hold the name `\" John\"`?\". They get a reply from the first `\" John\"` token, who also gives him their location. So he now knows that `\" John\"` is repeated, and he knows that the first `\" John\"` token is 4th in the sequence.\n",
    "    * These are *Duplicate Token Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"which names are repeated?\", and you get an answer from the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. You now also know that `\" John\"` is repeated, and where the first `\" John\"` token is.\n",
    "    * These are *S-Inhibition Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\". You get a reply from the person holding the `\" Mary\"` token, who tells you that they have name `\" Mary\"`. You use this as your prediction.\n",
    "    * These are *Name Mover Heads*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fine first-pass understanding of how the circuit works. A few other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person after the first `\" John\"` (holding `\" went\"`) had previously asked about the identity of the person behind him. So he knows that the 4th person in the sequence holds the `\" John\"` token, meaning he can also reply to the question of the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. *(previous token heads / induction heads)*\n",
    "    * This might not seem necessary, but since previous token heads / induction heads are just a pretty useful thing to have in general, it makes sense that you'd want to make use of this information!\n",
    "* If for some reason you forget to ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\", then you'll have another chance to do this.\n",
    "    * These are *(Backup Name Mover Heads)*\n",
    "    * Their existance might be partly because transformers are trained with **dropout**. This can make them \"forget\" things, so it's important to have a backup method for recovering that information!\n",
    "* You want to avoid overconfidence, so you also ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\" another time, in order to ***anti-***predict the response that you get from this question. *(negative name mover heads)*\n",
    "    * Yes, this is as weird as it sounds! The authors speculate that these heads \"hedge\" the predictions, avoiding high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.\n",

So if we perform singular value decomposition $W_Q W_K^T = U S V^T$, then we see that we can just as easily define $W_Q = U \\sqrt{S}$ and $W_K = V \\sqrt{S}$ and use these instead. This means that $W_Q$ and $W_K$ both have orthogonal columns with matching norms. You can investigate this yourself (e.g. using the code below).

    "We now want to find a reference prompt to run the model on. Even though our ultimate goal is to reverse engineer how this behaviour is done in general, often the best way to start out in mechanistic interpretability is by zooming in on a concrete example and understanding it in detail, and only *then* zooming out and verifying that our analysis generalises. In section 3, we'll work with a dataset similar to the one used by the paper authors, but this probably wouldn't be the first thing we reached for if we were just doing initial investigations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run the model on 4 instances of this task, each prompt given twice - one with the first name as the indirect object, one with the second name. To make our lives easier, we'll carefully choose prompts with single token names and the corresponding names in the same token positions.\n",

    "We want models that can take in arbitrary text, but models need to have a fixed vocabulary. So the solution is to define a vocabulary of **tokens** and to deterministically break up arbitrary text into tokens. Tokens are, essentially, subwords, and are determined by finding the most frequent substrings - this means that tokens vary a lot in length and frequency!\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokens are a *massive* headache and are one of the most annoying things about reverse engineering language models... Different names will be different numbers of tokens, different prompts will have the relevant tokens at different positions, different prompts will have different total numbers of tokens, etc. Language models often devote significant amounts of parameters in early layers to convert inputs from tokens to a more sensible internal format (and do the reverse in later layers). You really, really want to avoid needing to think about tokenization wherever possible when doing exploratory analysis (though, of course, it's relevant later when trying to flesh out your analysis and make it rigorous!). HookedTransformer comes with several helper methods to deal with tokens: `to_tokens, to_string, to_str_tokens, to_single_token, get_token_position`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise:** I recommend using `model.to_str_tokens` to explore how the model tokenizes different strings. In particular, try adding or removing spaces at the start, or changing capitalization - these change tokenization!</details>"

    "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",

And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant. See [my clean GPT-2 implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Clean_Transformer_Implementation) for more on LayerNorm.\n",

    "The obvious limitation to the techniques used above is that they only look at the very end of the circuit - the parts that directly affect the logits. Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique we'll use to investigate this is called **activation patching**. This was first introduced in [David Bau and Kevin Meng's excellent ROME paper](https://rome.baulab.info/), there called causal tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent."

    "\n",
    "We might call this algorithm a type of **noising**, since we're running the model on a clean input and adding noise by patching in from the corrupted input. We can also consider the opposite algorithm, **denoising**, where we run the model on a corrupted input and remove noise by patching in from the clean input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When would you use noising vs denoising? It depends on your goals. The results of denoising are much stronger, because showing that a component or set of components is sufficient for a task is a big deal. On the other hand, the complexity of transformers and interdependence of components means that noising a model can have unpredictable consequences. If loss goes up when we ablate a component, it doesn't necessarily mean that this component was necessary for the task. As an example, ablating MLP0 in gpt2-small seems to make performance much worse on basically any task (because it acts as a kind of extended embedding; more on this later in these exercises), but it's not doing anything important which is *specfic* for the IOI task."

Patching by replacing corrupted residual stream values with clean values is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object. If a component is important, then patching in (replacing that component's corrupted output with its clean output) will reverse the signal that this component produces, hence making performance much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - the noising and denoising terminology doesn't exactly fit here, since the \"noised dataset\" actually **reverses** the signal rather than erasing it. The reason we're describing this as denoising is more a matter of framing - we're trying to figure out which components / activations are **sufficient** to recover performance, rather than which are **necessary**. If you're ever confused, this is a useful framing to have - **noising tells you what is necessary, denoising tells you what is sufficient.**"

    "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [Neel's walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition."
