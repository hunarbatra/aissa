    "# LLM intervention + Activation patching tutorial\n",
    "### Wednesday October 15th**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Welcome to the third lab for [AI Safety and Alignment](https://robots.ox.ac.uk/~fazl/aisaa/), MT 2025!**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is split into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1️⃣ We'll first introduce the `TransformerLens` (TL) library, recall the basics of transformer-based large language models, and see how TL provides useful tools for inspecting intermediate activations, and intervening during the forward pass.\n",
    "    * During this introduction, we'll learn how to add activation hooks to ablate various components--a very rudimentary tool for mechanistic interpretability!\n",
    "* 2️⃣ Following this, we'll jump into an excellent (shortened) tutorial directly from [ARENA](https://arena-chapter1-transformer-interp.streamlit.app/[1.4.1]_Indirect_Object_Identification), which walks through how to use two useful tools for mechanistic interpretability of large language models:\n",
    "    * [**direct logit attribution**](https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=disz2gTx-jooAcR0a5r8e7LZ)\n",
    "    * and [**activation patching**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05262)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This lab attempts to assume almost no experience with transformers / LLMs, but inevitably glosses over a lot due to time. There are lots of important technical details (e.g., handling of layer norm / centering) that are abstracted away by TransformerLens, which can be explored in as much detail as desired!\n",
    "\n",
    "We would recommend you prioritize diving deeply into any part that piques your interest, rather than rushing to finish the whole lab.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Throughout both parts of the lab, we will ground our exercises in the so-called ['indirect object identification'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) task, which we will see in more detail soon!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope & focus\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is focused on one particular aspect of mechanistic interpretability: tools for finding evidence for the importance of particular layers' activations for implementing algorithmic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other areas of \"mechanistic\" interpretability we won't have time to cover. Some of the interesting ones include:\n",
    "* Learning interpretable components / subcomputations inside language models (beyond SAE directions)\n",
    "* Monitoring for harmful requests / outputs, (in activation space or on CoT) designing better/more efficient monitors\n",
    "* Intrinsically interpretable architectures (we can either pre-train, or fine-tune on top of existing LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these sound exciting, feel free to reach out to chat!\n",

    "We'll start very basic, and cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Content & Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Loading & sampling from pre-trained language models\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by looking at how to find and load pre-trained models with TransformerLens, and how to sample from them for next-token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Know where to look to find available models\n",
    "> * Learn how to sample from the model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ Caching activations\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll look at how to return the intermediate activations throughout the network during a forward pass. If we want to manipulate internal activations/mechanisms, we first need to know how to get them! TransformerLens makes this very easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Recall the basic components of a gpt2-style encoder-only transformer language model.\n",
    "> * Learn how to return the values of specific intermediate layers' activations during a forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ Intervening during a forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond simply returning intermediate representations for monitoring, interpretability, feature analysis (etc), it's often useful to make **interventions** into the forward pass itself, to make predictable changes to the output!\n",
    "\n",
    "> ##### Learning Objectives\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Understand how TransformerLens hooks relates to PyTorch hooks and model interventions\n",
    "> * Write your own model hooks with TransformerLens, for:\n",
    ">     * zero-ablation\n",
    ">     * tensor token manipulation at specific target points\n",
    "> * Reason about which categories of layers might be performing which kinds of tasks, and use this knowledge to bring target changes to the model outputs.\n",
    "> * Leave this section with a hypothesis about which kinds of layers might be most important in the IOI task."

On the simpler side, you have something like inspecting attention patterns, which can give a decent (but sometimes misleading) picture of what an attention head is doing. These should be some of the first tools you reach for, and you should be using them a lot even before you have concrete hypotheses about a circuit. On the more rigorous side, you have something like path patching, which is a pretty rigorous and effortful tool that is best used when you already have reasonably concrete hypotheses about a circuit. As we go through the exercises, we'll transition from left to right along this spectrum."

    "## The IOI task\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when trying to reverse engineer a circuit in a model is to identify *what* capability we want to reverse engineer. Indirect Object Identification is a task studied in Redwood Research's excellent [Interpretability in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593) paper (see [Neel Nanda's interview with the authors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo) or [Kevin Wang's Twitter thread](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1587601532639494146.html) for an overview). The task is to complete sentences like \"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to\" with \" Mary\" rather than \" John\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper they rigorously reverse engineer a 26 head circuit, with 7 separate categories of heads used to perform this capability. The circuit they found roughly breaks down into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify what names are in the sentence\n",
    "2. Identify which names are duplicated\n",
    "3. Predict the name that is *not* duplicated\n",
    "\n",
    "Why was this task chosen? The authors give a very good explanation for their choice in their [video walkthrough of their paper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzwj0jWbvbo), which you are encouraged to watch. To be brief, some of the reasons were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a fairly common grammatical structure, so we should expect the model to build some circuitry for solving it quite early on (after it's finished with all the more basic stuff, like n-grams, punctuation, induction, and simpler grammatical structures than this one).\n",
    "* It's easy to measure: the model always puts a much higher probability on the IO and S tokens (i.e. `\" Mary\"` and `\" John\"`) than any others, and this is especially true once the model starts being stripped down to the core part of the circuit we're studying. So we can just take the logit difference between these two tokens, and use this as a metric for how well the model can solve the task.\n",
    "* It is a crisp and well-defined task, so less likely to be solved in terms of memorisation of a large bag of heuristics (unlike e.g. tasks like \"predict that the number `n+1` will follow `n`, which as Neel mentions in the video walkthrough is actually much more annoying and subtle than it first seems!).\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminology note: `IO` will refer to the indirect object (in the example, `\" Mary\"`), `S1` and `S2` will refer to the two instances of the subject token (i.e. `\" John\"`), and `end` will refer to the end token `\" to\"` (because this is the position we take our prediction from, and we don't care about any tokens after this point). We will also sometimes use `S` to refer to the identity of the subject token (rather than referring to the first or second instance in particular)."

There is also an accompanying intuitive explanation which you might find more helpful. However, I'd recommend you try and go through the notebook unassisted before looking at these.\n",

    "<summary>Intuitive explanation of IOI circuit</summary>\n",

    "First, let's start with an analogy for how transformers work (you can skip this if you've already read [my post](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/euam65XjigaCJQkcN/an-analogy-for-understanding-transformers)). Imagine a line of people, who can only look forward. Each person has a token written on their chest, and their goal is to figure out what token the person in front of them is holding. Each person is allowed to pass a question backwards along the line (not forwards), and anyone can choose to reply to that question by passing information forwards to the person who asked. In this case, the sentence is `\"When Mary and John went to the store, John gave a drink to Mary\"`. You are the person holding the `\" to\"` token, and your goal is to figure out that the person in front of him has the `\" Mary\"` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear about how this analogy relates to transformers:\n",
    "* Each person in the line represents a vector in the residual stream. Initially they just store their own token, but they accrue more information as they ask questions and receive answers (i.e. as components write to the residual stream)\n",
    "* The operation of an attention head is represented by a question & answer:\n",
    "    * The person who asks is the destination token, the people who answer are the source tokens\n",
    "    * The question is the query vector\n",
    "    * The information *which determines who answers the question* is the key vector\n",
    "    * The information *which gets passed back to the original asker* is the value vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here is how the IOI circuit works in this analogy. Each bullet point represents a class of attention heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person with the second `\" John\"` token asks the question \"does anyone else hold the name `\" John\"`?\". They get a reply from the first `\" John\"` token, who also gives him their location. So he now knows that `\" John\"` is repeated, and he knows that the first `\" John\"` token is 4th in the sequence.\n",
    "    * These are *Duplicate Token Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"which names are repeated?\", and you get an answer from the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. You now also know that `\" John\"` is repeated, and where the first `\" John\"` token is.\n",
    "    * These are *S-Inhibition Heads*\n",
    "* You ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\". You get a reply from the person holding the `\" Mary\"` token, who tells you that they have name `\" Mary\"`. You use this as your prediction.\n",
    "    * These are *Name Mover Heads*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a fine first-pass understanding of how the circuit works. A few other features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The person after the first `\" John\"` (holding `\" went\"`) had previously asked about the identity of the person behind him. So he knows that the 4th person in the sequence holds the `\" John\"` token, meaning he can also reply to the question of the person holding the second `\" John\"` token. *(previous token heads / induction heads)*\n",
    "    * This might not seem necessary, but since previous token heads / induction heads are just a pretty useful thing to have in general, it makes sense that you'd want to make use of this information!\n",
    "* If for some reason you forget to ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\", then you'll have another chance to do this.\n",
    "    * These are *(Backup Name Mover Heads)*\n",
    "    * Their existance might be partly because transformers are trained with **dropout**. This can make them \"forget\" things, so it's important to have a backup method for recovering that information!\n",
    "* You want to avoid overconfidence, so you also ask the question \"does anyone have a name that isn't `\" John\"`, and isn't at the 4th position in the sequence?\" another time, in order to ***anti-***predict the response that you get from this question. *(negative name mover heads)*\n",
    "    * Yes, this is as weird as it sounds! The authors speculate that these heads \"hedge\" the predictions, avoiding high cross-entropy loss when making mistakes.\n",

So if we perform singular value decomposition $W_Q W_K^T = U S V^T$, then we see that we can just as easily define $W_Q = U \\sqrt{S}$ and $W_K = V \\sqrt{S}$ and use these instead. This means that $W_Q$ and $W_K$ both have orthogonal columns with matching norms. You can investigate this yourself (e.g. using the code below).

You really, really want to avoid needing to think about tokenization wherever possible when doing exploratory analysis (though, of course, it's relevant later when trying to flesh out your analysis and make it rigorous!).

    "\n",
    "A good starting point is thinking though whether a tiny model could do this, e.g. a <a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html\">1L Attn-Only model</a>. I'm pretty sure the answer is no! Attention is really good at the primitive operations of looking nearby, or copying information. I can believe a tiny model could figure out that at `to` it should look for names and predict that those names came next (e.g. the skip trigram \" John...to -> John\"). But it's much harder to tell how <i>many</i> of each previous name there are - attending to each copy of John will look exactly the same as attending to a single John token. So this will be pretty hard to figure out on the \" to\" token!\n",
    "\n",
    "The natural place to break this symmetry is on the second `\" John\"` token - telling whether there is an earlier copy of the <i>current</i> token should be a much easier task. So I might expect there to be a head which detects duplicate tokens on the second `\" John\"` token, and then another head which moves that information from the second `\" John` token to the `\" to\"` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model then needs to learn to predict `\" Mary\"` and <i>not</i> `\" John\"`. I can see two natural ways to do this:\n",
    "1. Detect all preceding names and move this information to \" to\" and then delete the any name corresponding to the duplicate token feature. This feels easier done with a non-linearity, since precisely cancelling out vectors is hard, so I'd imagine an MLP layer deletes the `\" John\"` direction of the residual stream.\n",
    "2. Have a head which attends to all previous names, but where the duplicate token features <i>inhibit</i> it from attending to specific names. So this only attends to Mary. And then the output of this head maps to the logits.\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Spoiler - which one of these two is correct</summary>\n",

    "\n",
    "<h3>Experiment Ideas</h3>\n",

    "A test that could distinguish these two is to look at which components of the model add directly to the logits - if it's mostly attention heads which attend to `\" Mary\"` and to neither `\" John\"` it's probably hypothesis 2, if it's mostly MLPs it's probably hypothesis 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we should be able to identify duplicate token heads by finding ones which attend from `\" John\"` to `\" John\"`, and whose outputs are then moved to the `\" to\"` token by V-Composition with another head (Spoiler: It's more complicated than that!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that all of the above reasoning is very simplistic and could easily break in a real model! There'll be significant parts of the model that figure out whether to use this circuit at all (we don't want to inhibit duplicated names when, e.g. figuring out what goes at the start of the <i>next</i> sentence), and may be parts towards the end of the model that do \"post-processing\" just before the final output.

    "The easiest part of the model to understand is the output - this is what the model is trained to optimize, and so it can always be directly interpreted! Often the right approach to reverse engineering a circuit is to start at the end, understand how the model produces the right answer, and to then work backwards (you will have seen this if you went through the balanced bracket classifier task, and in fact if you did then this section will probably be quite familiar to you and you should feel free to just skim through it).

Importantly, this means that any linear function of the residual stream can be perfectly decomposed into the contribution of each layer of the transformer. Further, each attention layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each head (See [A Mathematical Framework for Transformer Circuits](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) for details), and each MLP layer's output can be broken down into the sum of the output of each neuron (and a bias term for each layer).\n",

This controls for irrelevant behaviour such as the model learning that John is a more frequent token than Mary (this actually happens! The final layernorm bias increases the John logit by 1 relative to the Mary logit). Another way to handle this would be to use a large enough dataset (with names randomly chosen) that this effect is averaged out, which is what we'll do in section 3."

    "\n",
    "LayerNorm is an analogous normalization technique to BatchNorm (that's friendlier to massive parallelization) that transformers use. Every time a transformer layer reads information from the residual stream, it applies a LayerNorm to normalize the vector at each position (translating to set the mean to 0 and scaling to set the variance to 1) and then applying a learned vector of weights and biases to scale and translate the normalized vector. This is *almost* a linear map, apart from the scaling step, because that divides by the norm of the vector and the norm is not a linear function. (The `fold_ln` flag when loading a model factors out all the linear parts).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we fixed the scale factor, the LayerNorm would be fully linear. And the scale of the residual stream is a global property that's a function of *all* components of the stream, while in practice there is normally just a few directions relevant to any particular component, so in practice this is an acceptable approximation. So when doing direct logit attribution we use the `apply_ln` flag on the `cache` to apply the global layernorm scaling factor to each constant. See [my clean GPT-2 implementation](https://colab.research.google.com/github/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens/blob/clean-transformer-demo/Clean_Transformer_Demo.ipynb#scrollTo=Clean_Transformer_Implementation) for more on LayerNorm.\n",

It also really surprising that there are *negative* heads - eg 10.7 makes the incorrect logit 7x *more* likely. I'm not sure what's going on there, though the paper discusses some possibilities."

    "The obvious limitation to the techniques used above is that they only look at the very end of the circuit - the parts that directly affect the logits. Clearly this is not sufficient to understand the circuit! We want to understand how things compose together to produce this final output, and ideally to produce an end-to-end circuit fully explaining this behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technique we'll use to investigate this is called **activation patching**. This was first introduced in [David Bau and Kevin Meng's excellent ROME paper](https://rome.baulab.info/), there called causal tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup of activation patching is to take two runs of the model on two different inputs, the clean run and the corrupted run. The clean run outputs the correct answer and the corrupted run does not. The key idea is that we give the model the corrupted input, but then **intervene** on a specific activation and **patch** in the corresponding activation from the clean run (ie replace the corrupted activation with the clean activation), and then continue the run. And we then measure how much the output has updated towards the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then iterate over many possible activations and look at how much they affect the corrupted run. If patching in an activation significantly increases the probability of the correct answer, this allows us to *localise* which activations matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, this is a **noising** algorithm (unlike last section which was mostly **denoising**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to localise is a key move in mechanistic interpretability - if the computation is diffuse and spread across the entire model, it is likely much harder to form a clean mechanistic story for what's going on. But if we can identify precisely which parts of the model matter, we can then zoom in and determine what they represent and how they connect up with each other, and ultimately reverse engineer the underlying circuit that they represent."

    "### Noising vs denoising\n",
    "\n",
    "We might call this algorithm a type of **noising**, since we're running the model on a clean input and adding noise by patching in from the corrupted input. We can also consider the opposite algorithm, **denoising**, where we run the model on a corrupted input and remove noise by patching in from the clean input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When would you use noising vs denoising? It depends on your goals. The results of denoising are much stronger, because showing that a component or set of components is sufficient for a task is a big deal. On the other hand, the complexity of transformers and interdependence of components means that noising a model can have unpredictable consequences. If loss goes up when we ablate a component, it doesn't necessarily mean that this component was necessary for the task. As an example, ablating MLP0 in gpt2-small seems to make performance much worse on basically any task (because it acts as a kind of extended embedding; more on this later in these exercises), but it's not doing anything important which is *specfic* for the IOI task."

Patching by replacing corrupted residual stream values with clean values is a causal intervention which will allow us to understand precisely which parts of the network are identifying the indirect object. If a component is important, then patching in (replacing that component's corrupted output with its clean output) will reverse the signal that this component produces, hence making performance much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note - the noising and denoising terminology doesn't exactly fit here, since the \"noised dataset\" actually **reverses** the signal rather than erasing it. The reason we're describing this as denoising is more a matter of framing - we're trying to figure out which components / activations are **sufficient** to recover performance, rather than which are **necessary**.

    "Before we patch, we need to create a metric for evaluating a set of logits. Since we'll be running our **corrupted prompts** (with `S2` replaced with the wrong name) and patching in our **clean prompts**, it makes sense to choose a metric such that:\n",

    "* A value of zero means no change (from the performance on the corrupted prompt)\n",
    "* A value of one means clean performance has been completely recovered\n",

Our \"null hypothesis\" is that the component isn't sufficient, and so patching it by replacing corrupted with clean values doesn't recover any performance.

    "* Tip - it's good practice to have `model.reset_hooks()` at the start of functions which add and run hooks. This is because sometimes hooks fail to be removed (if they cause an error while running). There's nothing more frustrating than fixing a hook error only to get the same error message, not realising that you've failed to clear the broken hook!"

    "### Tied embeddings (what MLP0 is doing)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often observed on GPT-2 Small that MLP0 matters a lot, and that ablating it utterly destroys performance. The current accepted hypothesis is that the first MLP layer is essentially acting as an **extension of the embedding**, and that when later layers want to access the input tokens they mostly read in the output of the first MLP layer, rather than the token embeddings. Within this frame, the first attention layer doesn't do much.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this framing, it makes sense that MLP0 matters on `S2`, because that's the one position with a different input token (i.e. it has a different extended embedding between the two prompt versions, and all other tokens will have basically the same extended embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does this happen? It seems like most of the effect comes from the fact that **the embedding and unembedding matrices in GPT2-Small are tied**, i.e. the one equals the transpose of the other. On one hand this seems principled - if two words mean similar things (e.g. \"big\" and \"large\") then they should be substitutable, i.e. have similar embeddings and unembeddings. This would seem to suggest that the geometric structure of the embedding and unembedding spaces should be related. On the other hand, there's one major reason why this isn't as principled as it seems - the embedding and the unembedding together form the direct path (if we had no other components then the transformer would just be the linear map $x \\to x^T W_E W_U$), and we do not want this to be symmetric because bigram prediction isn't symmetric! As an example, if $W_E = W_U^T$ then in order to predict \"Barack Obama\" as a probable bigram, we'd also have to predict \"Obama Barack\" with equally high probability, which obviously shouldn't happen. So it makes sense that the first MLP layer might be used in part to overcome this asymmetry: we now think of $\\operatorname{MLP}_0(x^T W_E) W_U$ as the direct path, which is no longer symmetric when $W_E$ and $W_U$ are tied."

    "Decomposing attention layers into patching in individual heads has already helped us localise the behaviour a lot. But we can understand it further by decomposing heads. An attention head consists of two semi-independent operations - calculating *where* to move information from and to (represented by the attention pattern and implemented via the QK-circuit) and calculating *what* information to move (represented by the value vectors and implemented by the OV circuit). We can disentangle which of these is important by patching in just the attention pattern *or* the value vectors. See [A Mathematical Framework](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html) or [Neel's walkthrough video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV5gbOmHbjU) for more on this decomposition."

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, we've seen a variety of tools to help us understand which layers are most important for the task of indirect object identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "These included:\n",
    "1. **Zero-ablation**: observing how the model output changes (if at all), once we remove its activations -- are these activations necessary for the task?\n",
    "2. **Direct logit attribution**: looking at the direct influence of a layer's output to the residual stream in increasing the logits for the correct token\n",
    "3. **Activation patching**: patching in target layers' activations from a 'clean' run onto a 'corrupted' run; are these activations sufficient to modify the output to the correct answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully along the way we've also learned a bit about how layer norm is handled in the network, and the benefits of the `TransformerLens` library for efficiently collecting a load of activations for downstream interpretability tasks!\n",
